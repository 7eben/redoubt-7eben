Hi, my name is Zebensui, but practically everyone calls me **Zeben**. The etymology of the name is due to the ancient aborigines who inhabited the Canary Islands called *Guanches*. [Zebensui](https://lalagunaahora.com/zebenzui-nombre-de-origen-canario-muy-en-boca-en-estos-dias-por-olga-maria-perez/) was a *Guanche* prince from the area known today as Punta del Hidalgo in Tenerife.

### My history

{:  .text-justify}
I am a computer engineer and I try to put my grain of sand in this world from Tenerife, in the Canary Islands. I studied at the University of La Laguna and developed a wide professional career in the company [Arte Consultores Tecnol√≥gicos](https://arte.dev/index.html) where I mainly developed knowledge in *backend* and *operations*. But I've also worked on *frontend* completing an advance *full-stack* experience. Today I work in full remote at [Mymoid](https://www.mymoid.com/), a company dedicated to Payment Gateways in which I continue to develop my career.

I am in love with nature, I live surrounded by mountains where I practice trekking and a sea where I can disconnect with life ([have you seen my Instangram?](https://www.instagram.com/7eben.mendez/)). My other anti-stress sources are running and cycling, accompanied by a few hours of gym.

If you don't see me with a computer in my hands, you will possibly see me playing sports or lost in nature.
